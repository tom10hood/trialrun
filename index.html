<h1> Norms and Exceptions</h1>
<p> The norm seems to be what the normal distribution of the data is. It is also called the smooth because when you look at it is smooth when looking at a graph. An example of an exception is given in the text is geology majors at the UNC. The data set is ranges from 20,000 to 5,000,000, the latter being the salary of Michael Jordan who was a geology major during college. Jordan's salary is far outside the norm, and raises the average salary to over $700,000, creating the variable in the data set that makes the data look like a sharp mountaintop instead of a smooth line. Exceptions are something that indicated the data set is truthful which is what is most important to the author. Exceptions a indicate the data set is truthful because they are not usually very helpful in proving a point. I discovered this when working on a psychology project last year, when there was one data point that really messed up my project. This data point skewed my overall data set making the data very difficult to work with. 	  </p>
