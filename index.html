<h1> Mindsets matter</h1>
<p>Mindsets matter because they can be a factor in determining intelligence. The two mindsets of the first video focuses on are: intelligence is fixed, and the idea that intelligence is not fixed, and dedication can grow your intelligence. This second mindset: the growth mindset is one the first video promotes because it is proven to increase students academic ability. 
The first video conducted an experiment to test their theory that mindsets have power. Researchers studied students entering 7th grade, asking them if they believed intelligence was fixed or if they believed they could grow their intelligence with effort. The results showed	students who believed intelligence was fixed decreased in academic performance while students with the growth mindsets increased in academic ability throughout the year. This indicates that a growth mindset can positively affect academic ability. 
	The second video asked people where they thought treeâ€™s mass came from. Initially I thought Derek was a troll, who only wanted to make people look stupid, but after finishing the video I saw his point; people must make mistakes to learn. Derek made the video not because he wanted to prove people wrong, but to increase the knowledge of others. 
	Both the videos have a point, people must struggle to grow. Dweck wanted students to struggle with their academic issues so they would develop to be more intelligent, and Muller wanted people to struggle with his question so they would retain the information after they told him their misconceptions. The videos were both made to show people have to struggle to grow.
